Even if the optimism and hopes for a strongly pro-crypto SEC does not come to pass, a tempering of the aggressive regulatory-by-enforcement approach taken under outgoing chair Gary Gensler would represent a tailwind for crypto.
A note of caution that should be included in any optimistic expectations for a pro-crypto SEC is that the policies enacted might not play out precisely as crypto investors or advocates might expect.
First, it indicates – along with the possibility of a pro-crypto SEC – that the U.S. is officially open and amendable to crypto investors and entrepreneurs.
Regardless of which individual is set to lead the SEC starting in 2025, crypto investors and advocates should be cautiously optimistic and prepared for substantive conversations as well as positive progress.","['procrypto', 'level', 'expect', 'investors', 'crypto', 'entrepreneurs', 'policy', 'advocates', 'sec', 'trump', 'regulatory']",12/1/2024,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/01/what-crypto-investors-can-expect-from-a-pro-crypto-sec/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.139
