5,De minimis disrupted: The fallout for fashion - Vogue Business,"The decades-old ‘de minimis’ rule — a seemingly innocuous trade provision allowing low-value individual parcels to be imported into the US duty free — has become ground zero for a high-stakes economic and political confrontation with China.
On 28 January — a week after President Donald Trump took office for the second time — Congressman Greg Murphy reintroduced the End China’s De Minimis Abuse Act, aiming to curb China’s ability to bypass tariffs.
Just like President Trump’s tariffs execution, uncertainty is the only constant for the future of de minimis shipping.
Trump issued an executive order on 1 February imposing a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports and suspending the de minimis rule for individual parcels originating from China until further notice — sending shockwaves through fashion.
From tourist perk to trade loopholeThe de minimis provision, once a small concession permitting Americans to bring back souvenirs without incurring taxes, has evolved dramatically.","['lowvalue', 'president', 'fashion', 'fallout', 'disrupted', 'minimis', 'rule', 'trump', 'trade', 'individual', 'revenue', 'customs', 'threshold']",2025-02-10,https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/de-minimis-disrupted-the-fallout-for-fashion,Vogue Business,https://www.voguebusiness.com,negative,-0.063,2025-02-10 09:23:37

7,Socialist Candidate on Track to Force Ecuador Leader into Runoff - Yahoo Finance,"(Bloomberg) -- Socialist challenger Luisa González did better than forecast in Ecuador’s presidential election, likely forcing President Daniel Noboa into an April 13 runoff in the crisis-hit nation.
Leonidas Iza, from a party representing the nation’s Indigenous communities, had 5%, meaning that his backing could be key for deciding a close runoff.
Ecuador was close to total chaos when Noboa took over as interim president in 2023, and remains in deep trouble fourteen months later.
In the second round, González has an advantage over Noboa in the fight to win over Indigenous voters, said Gabriela Panchana, a political communications specialist.

7,Incumbent Noboa leads violence-hit Ecuador's presidential vote - Times-Georgian,"President Daniel Noboa held a narrow lead in violence-hit Ecuador's election Sunday, amid a fierce challenge from a leftist rival who looked set to force a second-round run-off.
With just under half the votes counted, Noboa was on 45 percent and his nearest rival Luisa Gonzalez was on a much stronger-than-expected 43 percent.
Both Noboa and Gonzalez were shadowed by a phalanx of special forces, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2023 election, when a leading candidate was assassinated.
""We're only human, of course, you feel afraid,"" 47-year-old candidate Gonzalez told AFP from her childhood home on the eve of the vote.
Noboa has been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund to build a $4 billion fiscal war chest.","['noboa', 'rival', 'election', 'votes', 'vote', 'leads', 'president', 'violencehit', 'half', 'political', 'candidate', 'incumbent', 'gonzalez', 'ecuadors', 'presidential']",2025-02-10,https://www.times-georgian.com/news/national/incumbent-noboa-leads-violence-hit-ecuadors-presidential-vote/article_fd933666-84cb-5ea4-87ea-8730af0eed95.html,Times-Georgian,https://www.times-georgian.com,negative,-0.069,2025-02-10 10:25:45

Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's recent reinstatement of a 'maximum pressure' campaign—aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon—he expressed willingness to engage in dialogue.
Pezeshkian, however, remains dubious about America's intentions.
Speaking at Tehran's Azadi Square, Pezeshkian conveyed Iran's refusal to yield to external pressures while Iranian state media broadcasted massive rallies marking the revolution's anniversary as a demonstration of national unity amid rising tensions with the U.S. and Israel.

The protests came despite requests from several senior Supreme Court judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar, who had urged the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Yahya Afridi, to postpone the meeting.
The country’s top judge CJP Afridi decided to proceed with the meeting as planned as commission members meet today to shortlist five senior judges from various high courts for vacant positions in the Supreme Court.
As tensions escalated, authorities implemented heavy security measures, including road closures around the Supreme Court, which led to severe traffic disruptions in the capital.

With about 96 percent of the ballots counted early on Monday morning, Mr. Noboa had received 44.37 percent of the votes cast.
Ms. González, the closest of his 15 opponents, had 43.86 percent.
Polls before the election had suggested that Mr. Noboa, 37, could win a majority, making a second round of voting unnecessary.
But the race proved to be tight, apparently reflecting ambivalence about Mr. Noboa’s tough-on-crime tactics in Ecuador, which has been plagued for five years by a surge in drug-related violence.","['falling', 'reelection', 'short', 'president', 'win', 'round', 'election', 'runoff', 'majority', 'faces', 'waving', 'ecuadors', 'bid', 'noboa', 'votes', 'gonzález', 'mr', 'young']",2025-02-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/world/americas/ecuador-president-election-2025.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.079,2025-02-10 09:23:37

Both candidates secured nearly identical percentages of the vote, setting the stage for a closely watched run-off.
Noboa’s supporters, who had been buoyed by early exit polls suggesting a potential outright victory, expressed disappointment but remained hopeful.
Noboa’s presidency has largely focused on combating Ecuador’s severe gang violence, which has plagued streets and prisons alike.
As Ecuador heads toward the April run-off, voters are left weighing two distinct visions for the future amid ongoing concerns about security, the economy, and social stability.","['tight', 'violence', 'crime', 'economy', 'president', 'election', 'round', 'violent', 'runoff', 'social', 'ecuadors', 'noboa', 'noboas', 'vote', 'presidential', 'heads']",2025-02-10,https://www.arise.tv/ecuadors-presidential-election-heads-to-run-off-after-tight-first-round/,Arise News,https://www.arise.tv,positive,0.138,2025-02-10 09:23:37

Both Noboa and Gonzalez were shadowed by a phalanx of special forces, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2023 election, when a leading candidate was assassinated.
“We’re only human, of course, you feel afraid,” 47-year-old candidate Gonzalez told AFP from her childhood home on the eve of the vote.

At the same time, in the semiconductor industry, as the manufacturing process becomes more extensive the possible combinations increase exponentially.
Therefore, the application of quantum technology was limited to processes on a scale that could be approximated by classical computers.
This made it extremely difficult to derive a solution that optimizes the manufacturing process.
In this context, in January 2023 ROHM and Quanmatic began exploring an operating system using quantum solutions that take into account various constraints in the EDS process.","['rohm', 'manufacturing', 'process', 'initiates', 'technology', 'optimization', 'system', 'using', 'world', 'proofofconcept', 'quantum', 'university', 'quanmatic']",2025-02-09,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/quanmatic-completes-proof-of-concept-for-manufacturing-process-optimization-using-quantum-technology-with-rohm-and-initiates-full-scale-implementation-1034329902,Markets Insider,https://markets.businessinsider.com,positive,0.101,2025-02-09 09:06:32

15,Experts Warn Quantum Computing Could Eventually Threaten Inactive Bitcoin Wallets - Cryptodnes.bg,"Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, has predicted that in the future, quantum computing could access inactive Bitcoin wallets, potentially reintroducing large amounts of Bitcoin back into circulation.
While he acknowledges this risk, Ardoino stressed that it is still a long way off, as quantum computing is far from being capable of compromising Bitcoin’s cryptography at this stage.
Quantum technology, which has the ability to process complex problems that current computers cannot, could eventually target dormant wallets that are no longer actively managed.
However, Ardoino suggested that wallets in use will likely implement quantum-resistant measures before any threat materializes, safeguarding assets from such risks.
Despite the concerns, experts note that developing quantum algorithms capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is still an enormous challenge.","['eventually', 'bitcoins', 'remains', 'inactive', 'ardoino', 'bitcoin', 'experts', 'computing', 'threaten', 'warn', 'wallets', 'quantum', 'potential', 'technology', 'threat']",2025-02-09,https://cryptodnes.bg/en/experts-warn-quantum-computing-could-eventually-threaten-inactive-bitcoin-wallets/,Cryptodnes.bg,https://cryptodnes.bg,negative,-0.123,2025-02-10 09:23:37

With about 96 percent of the ballots counted early on Monday morning, Mr. Noboa had received 44.37 percent of the votes cast.
Ms. González, the closest of his 15 opponents, had 43.86 percent.
Polls before the election had suggested that Mr. Noboa, 37, could win a majority, making a second round of voting unnecessary.
But the race proved to be tight, apparently reflecting ambivalence about Mr. Noboa’s tough-on-crime tactics in Ecuador, which has been plagued for five years by a surge in drug-related violence.","['falling', 'reelection', 'short', 'president', 'win', 'round', 'election', 'runoff', 'majority', 'faces', 'waving', 'ecuadors', 'bid', 'noboa', 'votes', 'gonzález', 'mr', 'young']",2025-02-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/world/americas/ecuador-election-2025.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.079,2025-02-10 09:23:37

10,Opinion | DeepSeek raises fear of a cold war powered by accessible AI - South China Morning Post,"Chinese hi-tech start-up DeepSeek recently shocked the world by releasing a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that, it claims, rivals US company OpenAI’s ChatGPT in performance while blowing it away in cost efficiency.
Yet the Cold War analogy missed a key point: Sputnik came during the early years of a protracted, high-stakes conflict that the world managed to survive.
The timeline for an AI-powered Cold War 2.0 would not be nearly so forgiving.
Industry experts contest DeepSeek’s assertions that its AI model was built on relatively few lower-grade Nvidia chips for a mere US$6 million, in contrast to the hundreds of millions spent by Western companies.
Still, DeepSeek exists, and it is already changing how we use, deploy and apply AI models.","['deepseek', 'washington', 'opinion', 'cold', 'china', 'raises', 'world', 'sputnik', 'recently', 'war', 'model', 'accessible', 'fear', 'technology', 'ai', 'powered']",2025-02-09,https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3297566/deepseek-raises-fear-cold-war-powered-accessible-ai,South China Morning Post,https://www.scmp.com,negative,-0.105,2025-02-10 09:23:37

Drako says before the implementation of AI, security cameras had to be constantly watched by human eyes, and even then, most problems could not be addressed until after something bad occurred.
He says with the use of AI, cameras can automatically detect issues like fights, leaks, spills, and more and alert authorities immediately.

The doctor added that increased regulations on centralized systems, including potential geographic restrictions on data due to geopolitical tensions, could place further burdens on centralized AI projects.
The costs and regulatory burdens resulting from increased regulations would widen the gap between centralized and open-source systems, which are not susceptible to those constraints.

“In order to understand if the AI systems are viable, we look at how easy they are to use, how well doctors and nurses adopt them, and how they impact patient care,” says Dr Pinero de Plaza, a research fellow in Flinders’ Caring Futures Institute.
“It’s not just about making AI accurate; it’s about making sure it’s easy to understand, adaptable, and genuinely helpful for doctors and patients when it matters most.”Published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics, the study used PROLIFERATE_AI to assess the RAPIDx AI tool; designed to help emergency doctors quickly and accurately diagnose cardiac conditions by rapidly analysing clinical and biochemical data.","['plaza', 'health', 'systems', 'dr', 'eye', 'work', 'research', 'keeps', 'tool', 'ai', 'understand', 'pinero', 'doctors']",2025-02-08,https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/proliferate-ai-testing-health-ai-rapidx.html,healthcare-in-europe.com,https://healthcare-in-europe.com,positive,0.219,2025-02-08 09:21:17

Playing Catch-Up in AI DevelopmentFAQsWho is the owner of ByteDance?
Why is TikTok banned in China?
In Moldova, similar technology was used to falsely portray the country’s pro-Western president supporting a Russian-backed political party.Meanwhile, in the United States, an AI-generated voice clone of President Joe Biden was used to discourage voter participation in the New Hampshire primary, an incident that the state’s attorney general condemned as a direct attack on electoral integrity.While ByteDance has demonstrated its technological prowess, the United States is working to close the gap.
Former President Donald Trump previously announced a $500 billion private-sector AI investment, involving companies like OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, to accelerate American AI innovation.However, John Cohen, a former intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security, warned that the U.S. has been slow to react to the evolving AI-driven threat landscape.“The United States is in a dynamic and dangerous threat environment, fueled by online content created by foreign intelligence agencies, extremist groups, and criminal organizations,” Cohen stated.He added that tools like OmniHuman-1 could empower malicious actors to produce sophisticated deepfakes more efficiently and at a lower cost.As the world moves into an AI-dominated future, the unveiling of OmniHuman-1 raises urgent ethical and regulatory questions.Whether ByteDance will integrate this technology into TikTok or other platforms remains to be seen, but its capabilities underscore the high-stakes battle over AI supremacy between China and the United States.ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, was co-founded by Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo.Government device bans are typically driven by national security concerns regarding potential data access by the Chinese government.","['videos', 'ai', 'united', 'controversy', 'omnihuman1', 'capabilities', 'features', 'states', 'potential', 'bytedance', 'technology', 'aigenerated', 'human', 'ultrarealistic', 'tiktok', 'launches']",2025-02-08,https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/bytedance-launches-ultra-realistic-human-videos-ai-omnihuman-1-amid-tiktok-controversy-features-capabilities-more/articleshow/118073499.cms,The Economic Times,https://m.economictimes.com,positive,0.124,2025-02-09 10:01:22

The central bank had proposed tighter norms for lending to infrastructure projects, and proposed that banks set aside more funds for digitally-linked deposits, and plans to introduce a framework for 'expected credit loss'.
""We do not want to cause any disruption; we will ensure a smooth transition,"" RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said in a post-policy press conference in Mumbai.
The new proposals on liquidity coverage, which would have forced lenders to set aside more funds against digital deposits, will be deferred by at least a year till March 31, 2026, Malhotra said.
Rules asking banks to set aside more provisions against under-construction projects will also be delayed, he said.","['transition', 'india', 'credit', 'proposed', 'regulations', 'bank', 'set', 'governor', 'smooth', 'banks', 'banking', 'aside', 'rules', 'stagger', 'central']",2025-02-07,https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/india-central-bank-delay-higher-065946471.html,Yahoo Finance,https://sg.finance.yahoo.com,negative,-0.085,2025-02-07 14:42:12

| Credit: Chalmers University of Technology | Lovisa HåkanssonA new type of autonomous quantum refrigerator could give quantum computers ""a major performance boost"" and make them more reliable, scientists say.
Quantum computers need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures so scientists can tap into delicate quantum properties and perform calculations — as even the smallest environmental disturbance can ""flip"" their quantum state, causing errors.
“Energy from the thermal environment, channeled through one of the quantum refrigerator’s two qubits, pumps heat from the target qubit into the quantum refrigerator’s second qubit, which is cold.

17,Need to create regulatory framework to withstand AI’s unethical use: Piyush Goyal - The Economic Times,"ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThere is a need to create a robust regulatory framework with legal and policy assistance to withstand the unethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) and also support effective deployment of modern technology, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.At an event organised by the National Law University, Delhi, he also said copyright and AI today stand at the crossroads of a “very disturbing future” as AI has “every potential to disrupt the way we are working today”.“The speed at which we feel a ChatGPT or whatever the Chinese are now invented, I don’t even recognize that.
But irrespective, I do believe we are a long way away before we can consider that to be dependable,” Goyal said.His statement comes after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, became the most downloaded app.“It is important that policy makers and I receive your help to create the right regulatory framework, not necessarily only in copyrights, but through the various aspects of law that can be impacted through use of AI, and come up with robust regulations that can withstand both the misuse or unethical use of AI and which will also support ethical use of modern practices or technologies,” Goyal said.Noting that the government is seeing how it can engage with experts and colleges across the country to see what regulations need change to be able to adapt with modern times, he said: “I do hope we'll spend the next 12 or 18 months in working out more contemporary regulatory framework”.On the issue of copyright and AI, he said one sees near perfect counterfeits and copyrights these days.“One can visit China, and you can get all your Louis Vuitton and Hermes bags, also from a range of probably Rs 1,000-10 lakh, and you won't be able to prima facie (find the difference), and that after a month or two, it will start getting spoilt,” the minister said, adding that this is the case with a lot of substandard goods that used to come into the country.However, India is trying to stop these substandard imports through a greater focus on quality control orders and compete on equal terms with other high quality products.“Copyright and artificial intelligence today literally stand at the crossroads of a very, very disturbing future where we can either convert the use of AI ethically to advantage so that we can do a good thing as regulators of copyright, or we may land up with smart ways, through unethical use of AI, to misuse copyright protection… AI, in fact, truly has every potential to disrupt the way we are working today,” Goyal added.While on the one hand, AI can add to creativity, on the other hand, it can disrupt the authorship of genuine innovators and their rights, he cautioned.“But personally, I am not very worried about the advent of technology,” he said adding that technology can become a tool, but cannot ever substitute the human mind.“I do believe, with all advent of technology through the years, the human indomitable spirit has always prevailed.
And I am very confident that in the years ahead, we will continue to see the human mind holding forth, the human mind prevailing over all artificial intelligence,” he said.As per the minister, the Patents Office granted one lakh patents in 2024, from 6,000 patents in 2014.","['withstand', 'need', 'framework', 'ais', 'technology', 'human', 'today', 'unethical', 'copyright', 'regulatory', 'piyush', 'create', 'ai', 'working', 'way', 'goyal']",2025-02-07,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/need-to-create-regulatory-framework-to-withstand-ais-unethical-use-piyush-goyal/amp_articleshow/118023916.cms,The Economic Times,https://m.economictimes.com,positive,0.139,2025-02-08 10:26:50

“Beijing has obliterated the myth that used to prevail in Washington a few years ago that China can’t innovate – that it can only borrow and steal technology,” said Liza Tobin, managing director at Garnaut Global, a geopolitical-risk advisory firm, during the hearing.
And in her written testimony to the commission, she warned: “We are unprepared to sustain a prolonged conflict with our primary strategic rival.
The US defence industrial base now depends on a potential adversary for critical inputs, from rare earth minerals to advanced electronics and even the energetic materials used in explosives for weapons.”“We risk losing the next industrial revolution, which is unfolding as AI converges with physical industry to transform how things are made,” Tobin added.

Once operational, the complex could become the largest military command center in the world, more than ten times the size of the Pentagon, US intelligence sources have said.
Construction of the facility, which began in mid-2024, is part of a broader modernization plan for the People’s Liberation Army of China.
The size, scale and partly underground nature of the new site suggest it will replace the West Hills complex as the primary wartime command center.","['center', 'withstand', 'designed', 'building', 'wartime', 'china', 'military', 'massive', 'intelligence', 'nuclear', 'command', 'times', 'war', 'pentagon', 'complex', 'underground']",2025-02-07,https://sarajevotimes.com/china-building-massive-military-complex-bigger-than-pentagon-designed-to-withstand-nuclear-war/,Sarajevo Times,https://sarajevotimes.com,positive,0.058,2025-02-08 09:21:17

Key Points from the CFTC AI AdvisoryRather than focusing on the broader policy initiatives outlined by Commissioner Johnson, the CFTC Al Advisory provides a non-exhaustive list of existing statutory and regulatory requirements that may be triggered by Al use for CFTC-regulated entities.
The CFTC Al Advisory acknowledges that leveraging Al to detect and flag abusive trading practices, conduct investigations, and monitor markets in real time may be beneficial.
Commissioner Johnson’s Unaddressed ProposalsWhile the CFTC Al Advisory provides clarity on certain points, it does not address the broader measures advocated by Commissioner Johnson.","['cftc', 'dcms', 'standards', 'advisory', 'markets', 'technologies', 'commodity', 'emphasizes', 'market', 'existing', 'ai', 'al', 'future', 'dcos', 'regulatory', 'data']",2025-02-07,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/back-to-the-future-cftc-emphasizes-2709553/,JD Supra,https://www.jdsupra.com,positive,0.05,2025-02-08 09:21:17

10,How the US Could Undermine Its Biggest Advantage Over China - The Diplomat,"DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, went public with a model similar to ChatGPT-4, casting doubt on the United States’ international leadership in this field.
Despite these shifts, the United States still holds a key advantage that’s often overlooked: its system of alliances.
In 2022, for instance, the United States persuaded NATO to label China as a “security challenge” for the first time.
Since President Barack Obama’s Pivot to Asia – and especially as tensions between the United States and China have escalated since the mid-2010s – the rise of China has become the primary international concern for the United States.
Maintaining its current major advantage over its systemic rival is ultimately a choice the United States must make.","['biggest', 'power', 'china', 'international', 'alliances', 'washington', 'united', 'states', 'alliance', 'system', 'allies', 'undermine', 'advantage']",2025-02-07,https://thediplomat.com/2025/02/how-the-us-could-undermine-its-biggest-advantage-over-china/,The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com,positive,0.157,2025-02-08 09:21:17

10,The Air Force’s Sixth-Gen Fighter Dilemma: Can It Afford NGAD? - 19FortyFive,"-With China unveiling its own sixth-gen fighter, the debate intensifies: can the U.S. afford to fall behind, or will financial and political pressures force the Air Force to rethink its next steps?
The United States Air Force announced in late January that it was more than tripling the authorized spending ceiling for its Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program.
The new spending may be a sign the Air Force is inclined to procure a manned Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-generation jet fighter after all, despite the service’s leaders spending much of 2024 arguing it was unaffordable and possibly unnecessary.
And at the moment, the Air Force has yet to commit to buying one it can’t afford anyway.
Of course, the Air Force didn’t want a Navy design, given the billions it sank into separately developing NGAD.","['fighter', 'engines', 'combat', 'stealth', 'ngad', 'forces', 'force', 'air', 'fuel', 'sixthgeneration', 'dilemma', 'jet', 'aircraft', 'afford', 'sixthgen']",2025-02-07,https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/02/the-air-forces-sixth-gen-fighter-dilemma-can-it-afford-ngad/,19FortyFive,https://www.19fortyfive.com,positive,0.078,2025-02-08 09:21:17

This approach was officially adopted in 1979, enabling Taiwan to engage in some international activities while avoiding political disputes.

The unanimous ruling lets the longtime director of the state Elections Commission stay in her job and stymies the ability of Republicans to name a replacement.
The three Democrats on the commission abstained from the vote, saying a recent state Supreme Court ruling allowed her to remain in the job indefinitely.
A county judge agreed with Kaul, and GOP state lawmakers appealed the case to the state Supreme Court.
The ruling allows Wolfe to stay in the job unless the commissioners decide they want someone else in the post.","['lets', 'ruling', 'elections', 'setback', 'gop', 'director', 'wisconsin', 'court', 'state', 'commission', 'stay', 'wolfe', 'republicans', 'senate', 'job']",2025-02-07,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/wisconsin-elections-commission-director/,The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com,positive,0.146,2025-02-08 09:21:17

(Carlos Osorio/AP)The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state’s top election official, Meagan Wolfe, can remain in her role as a holdover after her term, rejecting state Senate Republicans’ attempts to oust her.
Wolfe has served in the role since she was appointed by WEC and confirmed by the state Senate in 2019.
This is because the state Senate needs to confirm WEC’s appointee for administrator, and the Democrats were concerned GOP legislators would reject her appointment, effectively firing her.
Despite WEC commissioners not voting to reappoint her, the state Senate voted on her appointment anyway, rejecting her along party lines in September 2023.
That same month, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) filed a lawsuit on behalf of Wolfe and WEC challenging Senate Republicans’ vote to remove her.","['amid', 'term', 'wec', 'senate', 'gop', 'court', 'wisconsin', 'state', 'administrator', 'official', 'wolfe', 'supreme', 'appointment', 'election', 'effort', 'oust', 'job']",2025-02-07,https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/wisconsin-supreme-court-allows-top-election-official-to-keep-job-amid-gop-effort-to-oust-her/,Democracy Docket,https://www.democracydocket.com,negative,-0.08,2025-02-08 09:21:17

That’s because training the AI in quiet, controlled conditions lets it master the basics, which it can then better apply to the real world.
Counterintuitively, this results in better performance than an AI trained in messier conditions akin to the real world.

Quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) instead of the traditional bits of classical computers which can perform calculations at speeds unattainable by today's technology.
To overcome the obstacle, the researchers, instead of moving qubits to achieve quantum teleportation, used quantum teleportation of logical gates (the minimum components of an algorithm) – across a network link.
""Previous demonstrations of quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum states between physically separated systems.

15,Coldest-ever qubits could lead to faster quantum computers - Livescience.com,"A new type of autonomous quantum refrigerator could give quantum computers ""a major performance boost"" and make them more reliable, scientists say.
Quantum computers need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures so scientists can tap into delicate quantum properties and perform calculations — as even the smallest environmental disturbance can ""flip"" their quantum state, causing errors.
In this state, qubits are likely to retain their quantum properties long enough to perform calculations accurately .
It does this by harnessing energy from reservoirs of heat created using microwave radiation, which is then directed into one of the quantum refrigerator's two qubits.
And unlike quantum dilution refrigerators, which are extremely complex and difficult to scale, the new, thermally-driven system is autonomous, meaning it doesn't require external control once started.","['computers', 'qubits', 'study', 'coldestever', 'refrigerators', 'quantum', 'lead', 'heat', 'minus', 'qubit', 'dilution', 'scientists', 'faster', 'state']",2025-02-07,https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/coldest-ever-qubits-could-lead-to-faster-quantum-computers,Livescience.com,https://www.livescience.com,negative,-0.073,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Kim Kyoung-soo is considered a liberal figure likely to launch a presidential campaign and contend with opposition leader Rep. Lee Jae-myung, the chair of the party who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election.
However, Kim received a presidential pardon in August last year, which restored his right to stand for election.","['returns', 'return', 'stalwart', 'opposition', 'jaein', 'liberal', 'main', 'presidential', 'facebook', 'province', 'promoon', 'president', 'yoon', 'party', 'rep', 'kim']",2025-02-07,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10414874,The Korea Herald,https://www.koreaherald.com,positive,0.177,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Though Ben Tzion and Kaziukėnas contend that, in the face of short-term disruptions, Temu has a leg up over Shein, Ben Tzion said, in the longer term, Shein may outcompete Temu.
And the second would be, can I find alternative production facilities outside of China?” Ben Tzion said.

While a lack of chips has made it harder to build AI models in the traditional manner, more Chinese firms are now competing and developing alternative techniques.

10,Oil set for weekly drop as Trump tariffs outweigh Iran sanctions - CNBCTV18,"Oil headed for a third weekly decline as worries that President Donald Trump’s tariffs on China will sap demand outweighed the new US administration’s first round of sanctions against Iran.West Texas Intermediate was steady near $71 a barrel, and is down almost 3% this week, while Brent crude closed above $74.
Trump has slapped levies on all imports from China, with the world’s biggest oil importer countering with its own more restrained measures, which will come into force on Monday.The trade war — and the potential for it to spread — has stoked concerns that it will hamper growth in crude demand and lead to a glut later in the year.
Trump has also pledged to boost US oil output, offsetting the sanctions on Iran, which may limit flows from the OPEC member.“With the majority of Iran’s remaining oil exports going to China, we will be watching if the country’s imports will be part of the broader US-China tariff dialog,” RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said in a note.
“However, questions remain about the duration of these measures and the potential rigor that will be applied to enforcement.”Crude has had a tumultuous week, soaring on Monday as sanctions were set to come into effect on Canada and Mexico — the two biggest foreign suppliers of crude to the US — before sliding as the measures were delayed by a month.
It extended those declines to the lowest level this year as the conflict with China raised concerns about demand growth.There are also signs of a loosening in physical markets.","['potential', 'measures', 'demand', 'week', 'iran', 'set', 'weekly', 'crude', 'trump', 'near', 'tariffs', 'china', 'oil', 'drop', 'outweigh', 'sanctions']",2025-02-07,https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/oil-set-for-weekly-drop-as-trump-tariffs-outweigh-iran-sanctions-19554212.htm,CNBCTV18,https://www.cnbctv18.com,negative,-0.103,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Photonic quantum computing is cited as promising for error correction and scalability due to photons’ ability to carry quantum information over long distances and interconnect processors via optical fibers.
Their quantum computers are expected to operate below 1MW, less than traditional high-performance computing centers.
Quandela’s hybrid approach, based on a technology that generates photonic qubits with unprecedented efficiency from artificial atoms (semiconductor quantum emitters), should enable the company to accelerate the scaling-up of its quantum computers.
By drastically reducing the resources required while maintaining the intrinsic advantages of the photonic approach, we are paving the way for the realistic industrialization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.","['reduces', 'optical', 'computers', 'quandelas', 'requirements', 'faulttolerant', 'components', 'photonic', 'approach', 'qubits', 'quantum', 'hybrid', 'computing', 'resource', 'number']",2025-02-07,https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/02/07/quandelas-hybrid-photonic-approach-reduces-resource-requirements-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing/,The Quantum Insider,https://thequantuminsider.com,positive,0.086,2025-02-08 09:21:17

Market participants continue to exercise caution, reflecting concerns over global geopolitical tensions and potential tariff-related risks, thereby leading to a restrained approach in Polyamide procurement despite the relatively balanced market fundamentals.
In the United States, the Polyamide market has experienced a stable pricing trend, underpinned by a well-matched supply-demand dynamic despite increased feedstock costs for adipic acid and benzene.
As weather conditions improved and port operations gradually resumed, the market was able to re-establish a stable supply chain.

7,Unpacking President Yoon’s martial law attempt: A Q&A with Dr Jeong-In Yun on South Korea’s democracy - International IDEA,"To explore the impact of recent events on South Korea’s democracy, I spoke with Dr Jeong-In Yun, a research professor and constitutional law expert at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea.
What key events led President Yoon to declare martial law?
Several martial law prevention laws are also being considered to enhance parliamentary control over its declaration.
As a constitutional law scholar, I think civic education is vital for bridging these divides and reinforcing constitutional values.
It is evident that abuse of martial law without a crisis is both unconstitutional and a move towards autocracy.","['yoons', 'koreas', 'yoon', 'opposition', 'law', 'president', 'jeongin', 'impeachment', 'election', 'south', 'court', 'unpacking', 'martial', 'dr', 'qa', 'constitutional']",2025-02-06,https://www.idea.int/blog/unpacking-president-yoons-martial-law-attempt-qa-dr-jeong-yun-south-koreas-democracy,International IDEA,https://www.idea.int,positive,0.079,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Debbie Mayfield wants the state’s highest court to force the Florida Department of State to include her on the ballot for the special election for the state Senate seat she held for eight years.

Mayfield notified the division of her resignation from her House seat last month, which is effective on June 9, to be able to run for the Senate seat.

17,Capitol Hill Hearing Pushes for ‘Rational’ Community Banking Regulation - PYMNTS.com,"Beware the dangers of regulatory “overreach” and a one-size-fits-all approach to community banking oversight, several industry participants testified at a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday (Feb. 5).
And according to testimony from some participants, Congress should also look toward repealing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules tied to overdraft fees and small business lending data collection, arguing that open banking rules should also be delayed.
“Community banks have suffered immensely as increased regulatory requirements force them to devote more and more resources to lawyers and check-the-box compliance programs instead of serving their customers,” the Republican contended.
The “rational regulation” of the industry, she said, would also entail placing the CFPB under the congressional appropriations processes.
Among her own recommendations were to raise the deposit insurance cap for small business accounts and require FinTechs to comply with existing consumer compliance laws, which would level the playing field between those digital upstarts and community banks.","['community', 'bank', 'rules', 'cfpb', 'regulation', 'house', 'banking', 'rational', 'regulatory', 'state', 'spotlights', 'congress', 'hearing', 'testimony', 'banks']",2025-02-06,https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2025/capitol-hill-hearing-spotlights-a-push-for-rational-community-banking-regulation/,PYMNTS.com,https://www.pymnts.com,negative,-0.069,2025-02-07 01:17:11

The study highlights specific genetic pathways through which olive oil bioactives modulate insulin signaling, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress, shedding light on their molecular effects.
Polyphenols: Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory EffectsPolyphenols, including hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, and tyrosol, are potent antioxidants found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).
ConclusionsClinical studies suggest that different olive oil varieties and processing methods influence their polyphenol content, meaning that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with higher polyphenol concentrations may offer superior anti-diabetic benefits compared to refined olive oil.

Quantum computers, however, use qubits, which can exist in a state of quantum superposition, meaning they can be two things at the same time.
This makes quantum computers more powerful than traditional computers because they leverage this quantum ability to coordinate computations more efficiently and steer toward optimal solutions faster.
That said, if quantum activity in the brain is verified, and quantum mechanics is related to human consciousness, it raises some remarkable questions.","['brain', 'ways', 'computers', 'process', 'consciousness', 'traditional', 'human', 'quantum', 'humans', 'souls', 'maybe', 'think']",2025-02-06,https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/where-physics-meets-psychology/202502/if-humans-had-souls-would-they-be-quantum,Psychology Today,https://www.psychologytoday.com,positive,0.15,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Is Trump overestimating the resilience of the US economy and markets?
For many investors, Trump’s impulsiveness and unpredictability support the narrative that he is a deal maker who engages in extreme brinkmanship but prioritises financial stability when push comes to shove.
Trump’s willingness to pause tariffs on Mexico and Canada, coupled with his less aggressive stance towards China , are grist to the mill for investors in US stocks.
This adds to uncertainty over trade policy, contributing to differing interpretations of Trump’s renewed assault on the global trading system.","['reputation', 'creditworthiness', 'alight', 'tariffs', 'mexico', 'trumps', 'investors', 'trade', 'setting', 'canada', 'willingness', 'trump', 'trading', 'macroscope', 'posed']",2025-02-06,https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3297558/how-trump-setting-us-reputation-and-creditworthiness-alight,South China Morning Post,https://www.scmp.com,negative,-0.11,2025-02-07 01:17:11

In yesterday’s vote, 215 of the House’s 306 members backed the resolution that set forth the articles of impeachment.
Duterte is one of only four high-ranking officials, including former President Joseph Estrada, to face an impeachment vote since 1986.
All of the accusations against Duterte stem from the increasingly bitter political feud between the Duterte and Marcos clans.

7,The fundamental flaws with early voting - The Korea JoongAng Daily,"While I personally believe such claims are nothing more than unscientific conspiracy theories, I do see legitimate issues with early voting that are entirely separate from these allegations.Introduced in 2014 during local elections, early voting was initially hailed as a way to boost voter turnout.
However, early voting is held four to five days prior to election day, meaning that early voters cast their ballots with access to the latest poll results, while those voting on election day remain in the dark.Take the 2022 presidential election as an example.
The information asymmetry between early voters and election-day voters is not just unfair — it has the potential to alter electoral outcomes.Another fundamental problem with early voting is that it fails to account for late-breaking political developments.
In 2024, Korea spent 68.7 billion won ($51 million) on early voting, surpassing the 68.0 billion won budget for election day voting.
And the fiscal burden of running early voting operations may not be justified when alternative turnout-boosting measures could be more effective.","['election', 'early', 'won', 'flaws', 'day', 'fundamental', 'ballots', 'voting', 'polling', 'cast', 'voters', 'voter']",2025-02-06,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-02-07/opinion/columns/the-fundamental-flaws-with-early-voting/2236739,The Korea JoongAng Daily,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com,positive,0.094,2025-02-07 01:17:11

FARA requires that anyone in the U.S. accepting payment from or representing a foreign government must register and disclose such information to the federal government.

From failing crops and erratic rainfall to war-driven food shortages, the intersection of these crises threatens global food security and economic stability.
Climate change is significantly impacting agriculture, with extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts, devastating floods, and heatwaves reducing crop yields.
The result is a vicious cycle where climate change exacerbates conflict and conflict, in turn, deepens the impact of climate change on food production.
The findings in ""Crops, Conflict, and Climate Change"" serve as a stark reminder that the world cannot afford to ignore the intersection of climate change and conflict.","['climate', 'global', 'food', 'world', 'vulnerable', 'conflict', 'sustainable', 'fueling', 'change', 'crisis', 'crops', 'agricultural']",2025-02-06,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/3253641-how-climate-change-and-conflict-are-fueling-a-global-food-crisis,Devdiscourse,https://www.devdiscourse.com,negative,-0.21,2025-02-07 01:17:11

7,New Attorney General Pam Bondi orders review of Trump cases as she takes over the Justice Dept. - KSL NewsRadio,"WASHINGTON (AP) — New Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump as she unveiled a series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department the president claims is biased against conservatives.
The group will also review “unethical prosecutions” stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo.
Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.
Trump praised Bondi’s record as a prosecutor and said she will restore “fair, equal and impartial justice” at the department.
FBI agents this week sued after the Justice Department demanded that the bureau turn over the names of all agents involved in the Jan. 6 probe, which agents believe may be a precursor to mass firings.","['federal', 'agents', 'justice', 'takes', 'pam', 'general', 'trump', 'bondi', 'white', 'president', 'review', 'cases', 'weaponization', 'memo', 'dept', 'orders', 'department']",2025-02-06,https://kslnewsradio.com/elections-politics-government/new-attorney-general-pam-bondi-orders-review-of-trump-cases-as-she-takes-over-the-justice-dept/2178969/,KSL NewsRadio,https://kslnewsradio.com,positive,0.113,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity.
The team at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Oxford used a photonic quantum network to share the states of trapped ion qubits via quantum gate teleportation (QGT).
These uses dedicated network qubits to deterministically teleport the state of a gate between the two circuit qubits in the separate modules with 86% fidelity.
The two qubit distributed system was then used as a quantum computer to execute an algorithm, Grover’s quantum search algorithm, with a 71% success rate.","['scale', 'network', 'qgt', 'qubits', 'dqc', 'computing', 'teleporting', 'quantum', 'distributed', 'computer', 'designs', 'used', 'modules', 'qubit']",2025-02-06,https://www.eenewseurope.com/en/teleporting-qubits-scale-quantum-computer-designs/,eeNews Europe,https://www.eenewseurope.com,positive,0.058,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Russia's longtime ally Assad was overthrown in a shock rebel offensive in December, bringing the future of Moscow's Tartus Naval Base and Khmeimim Air Base into question.
According to Abu Qasra, Syria would consider allowing Moscow to keep the bases as long as the deal served Damascus’ interests.
Russia’s stance toward the new Syrian government, too, has “improved significantly” since Assad's overthrow in December, Abu Qasra told The Washington Post.

7,New Attorney General Pam Bondi orders review of Trump cases as she takes over DOJ - WDSU New Orleans,"Advertisement New Attorney General Pam Bondi orders review of Trump cases as she takes over DOJ Share Copy Link CopyNew Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump as she unveiled a series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department the president claims is biased against conservatives.Hours after she was sworn in at the White House, Bondi called for the creation of a “weaponization working group” that will scrutinize the work of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases.
Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.Smith has forcefully defended the prosecutions, saying politics played no part in the decisions of his team, who he said “stood up for the rule of law.""
“I will restore integrity to the Justice Department and I will fight violent crime throughout this country and throughout this world, and make America safe again.
The only employees who should be concerned, Bove wrote, “are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent.
""“There is no honor in the ongoing efforts to distort that simple truth or protect culpable actors from scrutiny on these issues, which have politicized the Bureau, harmed its credibility and distracted the public from the excellent work being done everyday,” Bove wrote.","['justice', 'bondi', 'begins', 'president', 'attorney', 'overhaul', 'general', 'bondis', 'federal', 'trump', 'memo', 'department', 'review']",2025-02-06,https://www.wdsu.com/article/pam-bondi-justice-department-overhaul/63686855,WDSU New Orleans,https://www.wdsu.com,positive,0.14,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Capital gains taxes and familiar habits from investing in mutual funds throughout the 1970s going forward make Baby Boomers reluctant to switch to ETFs.
If enough Baby Boomers begin to shift assets en masse, the sheer volume could create greater stock market volatility.
This has been attributed to several timing and human nature factors, such as:Many Baby Boomers first started investing during the 1970s and 1980s.

15,Oxford scientists achieve teleportation with quantum supercomputer - Yahoo News UK,"Oxford researchers say the quantum teleportation they achieved lays groundwork for 'quantum internet' (Creative Commons)A major milestone in quantum computing has been achieved after researchers at the University of Oxford built a scalable quantum supercomputer capable of quantum teleportation.
It is not the first time that scientists have achieved quantum teleportation, with teams previously transferring data from one location to another without moving qubits.
However it is the first demonstration of quantum teleportation of logical gates – the minimum components of an algorithm – across a network link.
“In our study, we use quantum teleportation to create interactions between these distant systems.
By carefully tailoring these interactions, we can perform logical quantum gates – the fundamental operations of quantum computing – between qubits housed in separate quantum computers.","['technology', 'scientists', 'computing', 'researchers', 'transferring', 'quantum', 'supercomputer', 'teleportation', 'oxford', 'achieved', 'qubits', 'achieve', 'university']",2025-02-06,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/oxford-scientists-achieve-teleportation-quantum-183401613.html,Yahoo News UK,https://uk.news.yahoo.com,positive,0.079,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Hayes contends that a government-backed Bitcoin reserve could introduce volatility into the market.
He notes that political motivations, rather than financial strategy, would dictate the government’s Bitcoin policies, potentially leading to disruptive sell-offs.
Instead of a government-managed Bitcoin reserve, Hayes proposes that Bitcoin should be recognized as a neutral reserve asset that remains independent of state control.
He suggests that a progressive approach to integrating Bitcoin into the global financial system would provide greater long-term stability than direct government intervention.","['financial', 'neutral', 'arthur', 'bill', 'regulatory', 'political', 'net', 'blasts', 'reserve', 'strategy', 'bitcoin', 'hayes', 'negatives', 'strategic', 'suggests', 'policymakers']",2025-02-06,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/02/43532705/arthur-hayes-blasts-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-regulatory-bill-as-net-negatives,Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com,negative,-0.044,2025-02-07 01:17:11

“Financial markets must grow in tandem with the economy’s capital needs and overall economic growth, rather than outpacing them,” it cautioned.
The Survey warned that “over-finance” can lead to the financial sector competing with the real sector for resources, including skilled labour.
Research has shown that rapid financial sector growth often favours projects with high collateral but low productivity, such as construction.
However, the Survey warned that there is a tipping point beyond which financial development can actually hinder economic growth.","['real', 'crisis', 'financialisation', 'growth', 'sector', 'warns', 'warned', 'excessive', 'economic', 'financial', 'economy', 'guard', 'survey', 'india']",2025-01-31,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-guard-against-excessive-financialisation-economic-survey-9809942/,The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com,negative,-0.107,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The recently concluded Economic Survey 2024-25 has attributed this higher than expected food inflation to adverse weather conditions and supply chain disruptions.

7,Outrage as leading Romanian presidential candidate calls Ukraine ‘a fictional state’ - Новая газета. Европа,"Far-right Romanian presidential candidate Călin Georgescu has sparked outrage in Kyiv by calling Ukraine a “fictional state” and claiming that the partition of its territory at the end of the war would be “inevitable”.
In a post on X on Thursday, the Romanian Foreign Ministry “strongly reiterated” its unwavering support for “Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence within its internationally recognised borders”.
However, Romania’s top court annulled the election results in December amid intelligence reports of “aggressive” hybrid attacks being launched at the country by Moscow as well as a Russian bot campaign on TikTok.
Both candidates condemned the Constitutional Court’s decision to annul the results of the first round, with Lasconi calling it “an affront to the very essence of democracy”.
While a rerun of the presidential election has now been scheduled for May, Georgescu continues to lead the race according to opinion polls, with some 38% of voters saying that they planned to vote for him.","['europe', 'candidate', 'election', 'liberal', 'fictional', 'novaya', 'leading', 'ukraine', 'outrage', 'presidential', 'round', 'georgescu', 'romanian', 'state', 'leader', 'vote', 'gazeta']",2025-01-31,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/01/31/outrage-as-leading-romanian-presidential-candidate-calls-ukraine-a-fictional-state-en-news,Новая газета.

“Onions are grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, with around 70% of production occurring during the Rabi season.
The lower production of onions in 2022-23 and 2023-24 has also led to inflationary pressures in onions.
Tomato production, the survey noted, is mainly concentrated in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha and this regional concentration makes the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions in any of these areas.

Since the tool made its debut this month, rattling stock markets and more established tech giants like Nvidia, researchers testing its capabilities have found that the answers it gives not only spread Chinese propaganda but also parrot disinformation campaigns that China has used to undercut its critics around the world.
In one instance, the chatbot misstated remarks by former President Jimmy Carter that Chinese officials had selectively edited to make it appear that he had endorsed China’s position that Taiwan was part of the People’s Republic of China.
The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”In the case of the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, Cybernews, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”","['answers', 'propaganda', 'researchers', 'deepseek', 'include', 'chatbot', 'deepseeks', 'gives', 'china', 'chinese', 'chinas', 'youre', 'disinformation', 'say']",2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/technology/deepseek-chinese-propaganda.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,0.086,2025-01-31 21:07:24

One possible outcome of the Trump presidency is that it defines a rightward boundary for how much radicalism, disorder, and lawlessness voters will tolerate.
Trump is a guinea pig president who is going to test how much voters can stomach and probably go well beyond that.","['political', 'americans', 'prosperity', 'policies', 'test', 'democrats', 'problem', 'trumps', 'voters', 'presidency', 'failed', 'measure', 'trump', '20']",2025-01-31,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-20-will-test-how-voters-measure-prosperity-170312705.html,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com,positive,0.084,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The expert witness apparently “could not recall what input or prompt he used to assist him” in cross-checking his calculations with AI (id.).

In a circular issued on Wednesday evening, Sebi clarified that stock market educators can only use stock prices with a three-month delay, effectively preventing them from giving real-time trading advice under the guise of education.
This move is aimed at stopping the widespread practice of finfluencers running illegal advisory services without Sebi registration.
The regulations also prohibit associations between registered market entities and unregistered finfluencers, which Sebi had initially restricted in its October 2024 circular.
With this new regulation, many finfluencers who rely on real-time market speculation for their business model are likely to face challenges in retaining subscribers and clients.","['beware', 'prices', 'usage', 'educators', 'sebi', 'advice', 'live', 'market', 'realtime', 'education', 'stock', 'data', 'finfluencers', 'cracks']",2025-01-31,https://www.taxscan.in/finfluencers-beware-sebi-cracks-down-on-live-market-data-usage/485232/,taxscan.in,https://www.taxscan.in,positive,0.104,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Bipartisan legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s nonvoting delegate in the House, would give the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration more power over fake companies attempting to register with the agency.
Specifically, the Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act “would clarify that FMCSA has the authority to assess civil penalties against fraudulent actors that hold consumers’ personal goods hostage, allow FMCSA to leverage states’ enforcement of federal consumer protection laws related to the transportation of household goods and establish requirements to ensure that motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders that seek registration are operating legitimate businesses,” Holmes Norton said in a statement.
