23,The Future Of Secure Digital Transactions In The Wake Of Deepfakes - Forbes,"Cyber Security Ransomware Email Phishing Encrypted Technology, Digital Information Protected Secured gettyWith the advent of gen AI and deepfakes, how will we keep digital transactions secure?
With the rapid advancements in generative AI and deepfake capabilities, traditional identity verification methods are becoming increasingly obsolete in securing digital transactions.
It is trivial to construct a fake identity, generate a fake video or falsify income statements, bank records, you name it.
Establishing a secure identity authorization network would give individuals and businesses a secure way to use verified identity to authorize transactions, agreements, content creation, and other digital actions, in a way that we can instantly trust and execute.
By continuously adapting their identity verification strategies, institutions can stay one step ahead and do a much better job of protecting digital transactions, preserving the integrity of our systems of trust in the process.","['secure', 'trust', 'security', 'deepfakes', 'verification', 'better', 'wake', 'digital', 'identity', 'information', 'institutions', 'future', 'transactions']",1/16/2025,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2025/01/16/the-future-of-secure-digital-transactions-in-the-wake-of-deepfakes/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.2,

It was a dismal result for his opponent Dragan Primorac, who had the backing of the governing centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party.
Before becoming president, Milanovic was prime minister of Croatia from 2011 to 2016, and led the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) from 2007 to 2016.
He briefly inserted himself into the country's parliamentary elections last year by announcing he'd be running for prime minister, before a court ruled the move unconstitutional.
The governing HDZ has been the dominant party since Croatia gained independence more than 30 years ago.","['response', 'croatian', 'party', 'croatia', 'result', 'milanovic', 'minister', 'president', 'reelected', 'victory', 'prime', 'governing', 'hdz', 'landslide']",1/13/2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx5910ylyo,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com,positive,0.109,

Care providers, councils and charities have all warned of the potentially dire consequences of national insurance contribution (NIC) changes and rises in the “national living wage” announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, last month.
Other care providers may be forced out of business, it added.

Data mesh offers decentralized data management, so that only necessary data is collected, processed and retained by each domain.

The company is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information in the same way they talk to ChatGPT.
While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.
SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft’s Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI’s own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.
It added that sites can appear in SearchGPT even if they’ve opted out of having their content be used to train the company’s AI models.","['ai', 'chatgpt', 'google', 'intelligence', 'links', 'searchgpt', 'information', 'openai', 'engine', 'users', 'artificial', 'taking', 'answers', 'search']",7/25/2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-search-engine/index.html,CNN,https://www.cnn.com,positive,0.059,

Nato leaders have urged China “to cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort”, adding that Beijing has become a large-scale supporter of Russia’s “defence industrial base”.
“This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s defence sector,” the declaration said.

If you want to get really into the weeds, pay attention to the progress that quantum computing is making, as made evident recently by an announcement from Microsoft and Quantinuum.
The pair of companies made what TechCrunch described as a major breakthrough in quantum error correction, which could make quantum computing systems far more usable than before.
The gist is that they encoded several physical qubits into a single logical qubit, which made it easier to detect and correct errors.
The error rate in quantum computing is a material issue to the technologys performance, making the news that the two companies managed run more than 14,000 experiments without a single error pretty big news.","['quantum', 'era', 'led', 'minute', 'ai', 'today', 'tech', 'computing', 'quantinuum', 'techcrunch', 'computings', 'making', 'single', 'microsoft', 'progress', 'error', 'companies']",4/8/2024,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/techcrunch-minute-quantum-computings-next-era-could-be-led-by-microsoft-and-quantinuum/,TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,positive,0.141,

And thats more important than my own personal ambition, Christie said in January when he ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
The nonprofit, which does not disclose its donors, cannot directly fund a presidential campaign, creating a financial challenge for any contenders who want to run on the No Labels bid without significant personal wealth or a preexisting network of supporters.

7,Trumps colossal legal fees are draining his campaign at the worst time - The Hill,"To be sure, Bidens numbers are staggering compared to the Trump campaign, previously considered a fundraising behemoth after raising $774 million in the 2020 cycle.
Worse, Trumps campaign spent nearly $3 million more than it raised in January, taking in just under $9 million, but spending more than $11 million, as they continue spending on the Republican primary and his mounting legal fees.
While Biden is not inundated with the legal fees plaguing Trumps campaign, his spending on campaign ads reflects a candidate floundering to find a message that works.
In the last month of the 2020 campaign, Trump outraised Biden by $71 million and raised $91.5 million from grassroots donors alone during that same period.
And yet, there are legitimate questions of whether Trumps strategy of using campaign funds to cover consistently increasing legal costs is sustainable through November.","['bidens', 'trumps', 'money', 'legal', 'worst', 'million', 'spending', 'fees', 'draining', 'primary', 'biden', 'campaign', 'colossal', 'trump']",2/26/2024,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4488184-trumps-colossal-legal-fees-are-draining-his-campaign-at-the-worst-time/,The Hill,https://thehill.com,positive,0.047,

The support of Mr. McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky and the chambers minority leader, would also carry huge value in signaling to an entire class of donors and Trump-resistant Republican elites that its acceptable to get behind the partys expected nominee  no matter their misgivings.
This is no small thing, given that Mr. Trump has been forced to spend more than $50 million already on legal bills, and the groups supporting him are expected to be vastly outspent by President Bidens operation.

Mr. Bidens ability to raise cash  his campaign reported having $130 million in the bank over the weekend  has been a bright spot amid bleak polling numbers that show his popularity has sunk to near the lowest point in his presidency.
Campaign advisers say the numbers will rebound once the presidents team has had the opportunity to contrast his record with that of former President Donald J. Trump, who is widely expected to be the Republican nominee.
The campaigns success in raising money will determine how effectively the president can deliver that message to voters.
